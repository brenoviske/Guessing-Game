Hi devs.
How have you guys been?
In this new project of mine, I am introducing a very cool,simple and interesting game: The guessing game.
By using the Python language along with the framework Flask, this project consist in a guessing game against the computer, where the machine drwas a number from 1 to 10 and it is up to the user to try to guess it.
Each time the guessed number is not the right one, a message is displayed on the page informing the user about his result.
Feel free to check it out and don't forget to send me your feedback.
Peace to you all!!!
